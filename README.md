### Hi there! I'm Aidan 👋🏻

I'm a student in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.


Many years ago, I discovered a passion for computing.
I love of making cool things and have put that passion to making interesting software and electronic projects.
Check out some of the stuff I have made at [aidan-b.github.io][portfolio] and feel free to reach out to me.

I want to get into contributing to some open source projects. Let me know if you need some help! I have experience with Python, C++, Unity C#, Node & Javascript, PHP and more!
