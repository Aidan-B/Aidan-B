### Hi there! I'm Aidan 👋🏻

I'm a student in my final year of Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo.


Many years ago, I discovered a passion for computing.
I love making cool things and have put that passion to making interesting software and electronic projects.
I'm particularly interested in understanding how devices communicate with each other and precicely controlling them - by designing these systems or reverse engineering them.
